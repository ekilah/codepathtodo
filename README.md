## codepathtodo
This is a project to demonstrate my awesome skills to @codepath in order to enroll in their Android training class in SF in Q1 2015 @ zynga.

I spent only an hour or so on this so far.

As of c3ce3e1671e1cd2a0b19787a2db26d46fbf34004 the required sections are complete. checklist:
- [x] code
  - [x] successfully add and remove items
  - [x] editing feature
  - [x] file persistence
- [ ] git(hub) 
  - [x] pushed 
  - [x] readme
  - [x] gif
  - [ ] issue

I will add to this project before the training as I have free time (if/when!)

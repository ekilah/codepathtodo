## codepathtodo
This is a project to demonstrate my awesome skills to @codepath in order to enroll in their Android training class in SF in Q1 2015 @ zynga.

As of de288ae3bf186eb7355242f83e28e904313ab9d3 the required coding sections are complete. here's my crazy checklist:
- [x] code
  - [x] successfully add and remove items
  - [x] editing feature
  - [x] file persistence
- [ ] git(hub) 
  - [x] pushed 
  - [x] readme
  - [ ] gif
  - [ ] issue

I will add to this project before the training as I have free time (if/when!)

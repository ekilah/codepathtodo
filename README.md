## codepathtodo
This is a project to demonstrate my awesome skills to @codepath in order to enroll in their Android training class in SF in Q1 2015 @ zynga.

I spent only an hour or so on this so far.

As of `c3ce3e1671e1cd2a0b19787a2db26d46fbf34004` the required sections are complete. checklist:
- [x] code
  - [x] successfully add and remove items
  - [x] editing feature
  - [x] file persistence
- [x] git(hub) 
  - [x] pushed 
  - [x] readme
  - [x] gif
  - [x] issue
  

However, this is the most recent update on `master`: `b3cc5cbd4ffc44e6cfd09f2a348492a92f6a9747`

New features:
- Fragment for adding and editing instead of text box at bottom
- Date picker in fragment
- Custom list adapter for custom list UI (for date)


I will add _more_ to this project before the training as I have free time (if/when!)


##Demo time!
